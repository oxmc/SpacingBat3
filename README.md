### A few words about me:
- I'm happy to contribute in various open source software (at least when I have time to do that).
- I'm interested about the [<img src="https://github.com/TaranVH/LOGOS/raw/master/ARM%20logo_blue_RGB.png" alt="ARM" width=32px/>](https://www.arm.com)-based SBCs.
- For the ARM developement purposes, I use my [![](https://github.com/iiiypuk/rpi-icon/raw/master/16.png) Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/).
- I'm the author of [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord/master/sources/assets/icons/app.png" width=16px/> WebCord](../../../WebCord), which is a free and open-source [:electron:](https://github.com/electron/electron)-based [Discord](https://discord.com) client trying to improve the privacy and security, while being more customizable than the official client. It supports the ARM architectures as well and has builds for Apple M1 and Windows ARM devices.
- Althrough I developed much ARM-specific projects in the past, I'm now mainly focused at working with the multiplatform software.
- My preffered Linux distribution: [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JotaRandom/archlinux-artwork/master/icons/archlinux-icon-crystal-64.svg" height="16px" alt="Arch"/> Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and [its derivatives](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch-based_distributions).
