### A few words about me:
- happy to contribute in various open source software;
- interested about the [<img src="https://github.com/TaranVH/LOGOS/raw/master/ARM%20logo_blue_RGB.png" alt="ARM" width=32px/>](https://www.arm.com) SBCs;
- has a [![Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/iiiypuk/rpi-icon/raw/master/16.png)](https://www.raspberrypi.org) for the ARM developement;
- known for the [<img src="https://github.com/SpacingBat3/electron-discord-webapp/raw/master/icons/app.png" width=16px alt="Discord"/> WebCord](../../../electron-discord-webapp), which is [:electron:](https://github.com/electron/electron)-based client concerned about the compatibility with the Linux ARM;
- not a big fan of [<img src="https://github.com/TaranVH/LOGOS/raw/master/Windows%2010%20logo.png" height=16px alt="Windows 10"/>](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/) and [<img src="https://github.com/TaranVH/LOGOS/raw/master/Apple_logo_shiny.png" height=16px alt="Apples"/>](https://www.apple.com/macos) (so don't blame me if there's no stuff for these OSes, at least the one that's precompiled);
- ~~definitelly very active on his GitHub repositories~~;
- ...oh, almost forgot to mention â€“ *I use [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JotaRandom/archlinux-artwork/master/icons/archlinux-icon-crystal-64.svg" height="16px" alt="Arch"/>](https://archlinuxarm.org/) BTW* (or at least the Arch-based distribution).
